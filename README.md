# contact-api-test
sample code for keeping an up-to-date copy of the Firefox OS contacts database

to try this out, clone this repo and open the "contact-api-test" folder in WebIDE as a packaged app, then you can run it on your Firefox OS simulator and watch it track changes you make in the contacts app.
